- 👋 Hi, I’m Mārcis, also known as @MKCxlly.
- Currently working as a full time Civil engineering Assistant project manager.
- I also study Civil engineering at Riga Technical university.
- I have learnt to program C++ while at school, lost interest for a while and now have picked up programming yet again, though through a different approach.
- I am currently learning Python, I aspire to be able to do advanced programming.
- In the future I plan to learn HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, etc. to become a web guru to perhaps start a carreer in programming! :)
